# Amazon VPC Lattice - VPC Lattice service examples

This example shows how you can use the VPC Lattice module to create VPC Lattice services. The following examples are covered:

1. VPC Lattice service configured with a custom domain name and no auth policy. Access logs are configured for CloudWatch logs, S3, and Data Firehose.
2. VPC Lattice service configured with auth type "AWS_IAM".
3. VPC Lattice services associated to a service network.
4. VPC Lattice service with HTTP listener.
    * Default action fixed-response (404)
    * Rule 1 (priority 10) - If prefix "/lambda", sends all the traffic to *target1*
    * Rule 2 (priority 20) - If header "target = instance", sends a fixed-response (404)
5. VPC Lattice service with HTTPS listener (forward default action)

In the `outputs.tf` file, you can see an example on how to obtain VPC Lattice service attributes, associations' information, access log subscriptions' information, listeners and rules.
